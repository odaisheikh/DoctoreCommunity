## About us ? 
This Website was designed by three enthusiastic junior Web-Devlopers, The idea of Doctor's Community came from the need for a platform where patients can be offered safe medical advice from home. We encourage all the users of the platform to reach out to all the Doctors registered on the website. We hope that this Website will be a base for all Patients who cannot afford proper medical treatment, and do self check ups through listing symptoms to our expert on site doctors, We wish you a safe disease free happy life !
